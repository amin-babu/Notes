1. Immutable Data Type
---------------------
  => Immutable object cannot be modified after their creation

  => Immutable Data Type List
    1. Integer
    2. Floating Point Number
    3. Strings
    4. Tupels
    5. Frozen Sets

  => Immutable means
    => Imutable means when we declare a vairable and assign a value like A = 5. then if we reassign the value like A = 6, it doesn't mean we replaced 5 to 6, it means we redeclare a vairable and reassign the value.

  => Checking process of Imutable Data Type
    a = 5.66
    location = id(a)
    print(location)
    a = 6.41
    location = id(a)
    print(location)

  => The conclution is Immutable means the vairable data has changed, and also changed their location to creat new vairable.

2. Mutable Data Type
--------------------
  => Mutable Means
    Mutable means when we reassign a value, it does not change their location. It does not mean it created a new vairable and reassign the value. It just replaced the value. After changing the value, the location will not be changed.

  => Mutable Data Type List
    1. List
    2. Dictionary
    3. Sets

  => Checking process of Mutable Data Type
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    print(l)
    first_location = id(l)
    print(first_location)

    l[0] = 5
    print(l)
    second_location = id(l)
    print(second_location)
