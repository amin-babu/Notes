3rd party packages:
-------------------

only discussed about 3rd party packages like flask, django, fastapi, panda.

we learned python so far. we can work with packages to use python. we have decide that where do we want to go. it can be web development, ML, AI.

then we have to use the packages based on path.

this is the last module of python and i think we have learned enough python. that why we are starting to learn 3rd party packages or framework
