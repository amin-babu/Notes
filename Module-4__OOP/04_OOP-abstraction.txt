Abstract means can't access the parent class, will have to access using child class.


here is code
------------

  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

  class Bangladesh(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def sup(self):
      pass

    def district(self):
      print('Chittagong')

  class son(Bangladesh):
    def sup(self):
      pass

  object = son()
  object.district()
