Static Property => Static Methods and Variables
-----------------------------------------------

  => Static means accessing Variables and Methods outsite of a class without creating any objects, its called static Property.

  => Static Variables can access without setting any decorator like -> @staticmethod

  => Decorator will be needed when access any methods. Decorator is -> @staticmethod



Example
-------

    class MyClass:

      x = 10
      y = 20
      
      @staticmethod
      def AddTwo():
        z = MyClass.x + MyClass.y
        print(z)

    print(MyClass.x) #static Variables
    print(MyClass.y) #static Variables
    MyClass.AddTwo() #static Methods
