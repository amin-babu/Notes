OOP Statice Property in Inheritence
-----------------------------------


=> If parent has static properties, child can access as like as parent.

  => Example:
  -----------
  
    class Father:
      x = 10
      y = 20

      @staticmethod
      def addTwo():
        print(Father.x + Father.y)

    class Son(Father):
      pass

    Son.addTwo()


=> If child has static properties, parent can't access as like as child.

  => Only can access from child classes
